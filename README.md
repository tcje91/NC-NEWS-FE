## Getting Started

If you would like to experiment with the code used for this project, these instructions will get you up and running.

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed on your machine in order to run this project locally:

* Node.js
* Node Package Manager (npm)
* git (you will also need a github account)

### Installing

Once you have installed the prerequisites, **Fork** this repository using the button at the top right of this page. Then, from your personal fork, click the **Clone or download** button, also near the top right, and copy the link to your repository.

With that done, navigate in your terminal to where you would like to install the project, then run the following command to clone a copy to your local machine:

```
git clone repoURL
```
where repoURL is the URL to your forked repository.  

Now you must install the project dependencies using:
```
npm install
```
The following packages are used in the front end of NC News:

```
"dependencies": {
    "@reach/router": "^1.2.1",
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "react": "^16.7.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.7.0",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.3",
    "terser": "^3.14.1"
  }
```
Once these are installed, you can begin experimenting.

```App.js``` contains the app itself, including the main router and log in/out functionality.

The majority of the screens, components and styling are locating in the ```src/components/``` directory. These components and their associated stylings are roughly grouped by the screens in which they appear, though some components can be found on multiple screens.

To run a local development environment to view the effect of your changes, enter into your terminal the script ```npm start```. The app, along with any changes, should open in a web browser tab. You can continue to make changes and, provided there are no errors in your code and the development environment is still running, they will be immediately visible when you save them.

If you wish to exit the development environment, enter **Ctrl+C**/**Cmd+C** with the terminal highlighted.
